Single-center descriptive studies are valuable because they often reflect a homogenous patient population and consistent management protocols, providing a clear picture of how lupus nephritis (LN) presents and progresses in specific real-world settings.

The following is a summary of single-center descriptive studies from various regions, highlighting differences in patient demographics, histological patterns, and clinical outcomes.

1. North America
United States (New York/Urban Center)

Study Focus: A retrospective analysis of 163 patients with biopsy-proven LN, predominantly from minority populations (African American and Hispanic).

Key Findings:

Demographics: 90% of the cohort belonged to minority populations.

Histology: Proliferative LN (Class III and IV) was highly prevalent.

Outcomes: About 30% of patients with proliferative LN progressed to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) over a mean follow-up of 37.5 months.

Prognostic Factors: Hypertension and a high Chronicity Index (CI) on biopsy were independent risk factors for progression to ESRD. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a maintenance agent was associated with better sustained remission rates in this high-risk population.

2. Europe
Spain

Study Focus: A historical cohort of 190 white patients with biopsy-proven LN.

Key Findings:

Histology: Class IV (Diffuse) was the most common (38%), followed by Class III (24%).

Outcomes: The study reported excellent long-term prognosis, with a 92% 10-year survival rate and 80% 20-year survival rate. This contrasts sharply with cohorts with higher proportions of non-white patients.

Risk Factors: Male sex and elevated creatinine at diagnosis were strong predictors of renal failure.

Italy

Study Focus: A study of 89 patients investigating the role of IgG4 deposition in glomeruli.

Key Findings:

Pathology: 33.7% of patients had glomerular IgG4 deposition. These patients were more likely to have Class V (Membranous) LN.

Outcomes: Interestingly, patients with IgG4 deposition had better renal survival (96.7% vs 79.7%) compared to those without, suggesting a distinct phenotype with a potentially milder course despite lower serum albumin levels.

Poland

Study Focus: A comparison of early-onset (diagnosed within 1 year of SLE diagnosis) vs. delayed-onset LN in 331 patients.

Key Findings:

Early vs. Late: Delayed-onset LN was associated with more severe clinical manifestations and a higher frequency of specific autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith), highlighting the need for vigilance even in patients who have had non-renal SLE for years.

3. Asia
China

Study Focus: A large study of 896 LN patients specifically analyzing those with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Key Findings:

Clinical Impact: Patients with thrombocytopenia had higher disease activity scores (SLEDAI) and more active pathological features (necrosis, hypercellularity) on biopsy.

Outcomes: While disease activity was higher, renal survival rates were statistically similar to those without thrombocytopenia, though anemia was identified as a significant risk factor for mortality in this subgroup.

India (South India)

Study Focus: A long-term outcome study of 59 patients with biopsy-proven LN.

Key Findings:

Histology: Class IV was the dominant class (66%).

Outcomes: At ~7 years follow-up, 64% achieved complete remission. The patient survival rate was 84%.

Predictors: Poor outcomes were predicted by high serum creatinine and hypertension at presentation, mirroring findings from Western studies.

Japan

Study Focus: A study on repeat renal biopsies in 150 patients.

Key Findings:

Utility of Repeat Biopsy: Repeat biopsies were most common in males and those with Class IV LN.

Class Switching: Approximately 40% of patients showed a "class switch" (e.g., from proliferative to non-proliferative or mixed) upon repeat biopsy during a flare, emphasizing that the histological type of LN is not static and can change over time or treatment.

4. Australia
Indigenous Population Focus

Study Focus: A descriptive study of 40 patients (16 Indigenous Australians) in Far North Queensland.

Key Findings:

Disparities: Indigenous patients had more severe presentation (nephrotic range proteinuria) and poorer outcomes compared to non-Indigenous patients.

Outcomes: Rates of ESRD and death were notably higher (approx. 30%), reflecting challenges in disease severity and potentially access to care or response to standard therapies in this specific demographic.
