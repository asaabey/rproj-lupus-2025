## Dataset Overview

**123 patients × 42 variables** with lupus nephritis data including:

- Demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, community)
- Clinical (creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, haematuria, CKD stage)
- Lab values (Hb, platelets, HbA1c, complement C3/C4)
- Serology (ANA, ds-DNA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies)
- Histology (ISN/RPS class)
- Outcomes (ESKD, permanent RRT, mortality, transplant)

## Analysis Plan

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- Demographic profile (age, sex distribution, ethnicity breakdown)
- Clinical presentation at biopsy (median creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria)
- Distribution of ISN/RPS histological classes
- Prevalence of serological markers

### 2. Indigenous vs Non-Indigenous Comparison

*Highly relevant given the Australian Indigenous literature findings*

- Compare baseline characteristics
- Compare outcomes (ESKD, RRT, mortality)
- Time to biopsy differences

### 3. Outcome Analysis

**Primary outcomes:**

- ESKD (eGFR <15)
- Permanent RRT
- Mortality

**Key predictors to test (from literature):**

- Ethnicity (Indigenous status)
- Serum creatinine at biopsy
- Proteinuria (u_acr_at_biopsy)
- Anemia (Hb)
- Thrombocytopenia (plt)
- Low complement (C3, C4)
- Histological class (especially Class IV)
- Time to biopsy

### 4. Histological Class Analysis

- Distribution of ISN/RPS classes
- Outcomes by class (Class IV vs others)
- Class switching (for repeat biopsies)

### 5. Prognostic Modeling

- Univariate analysis of risk factors for each outcome
- Multivariate logistic regression for ESKD/mortality
- Consider Kaplan-Meier survival analysis if time-to-event data available

### 6. Serological Patterns

- Association of anti-dsDNA, complement levels with disease severity
- Antiphospholipid antibody prevalence and outcomes
